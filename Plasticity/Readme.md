Buckling and transient analysis of Boiler Surface

The things which are checked,
-Large displacements
-with Plasticity
-Buckling with imperfection (a small internal pressure of -1N)

Boundry Conditions

The Incoming and outgoing holes Surfaces are fixed.

Meshing
Meshing is done in Gmsh and Transfinite Funktion is used to do a finer meshing.

Set Defination
For example, In this Analysis, there are two sets defined in Gmsh, that are lower and Upper. You can check this Sets in .geo file.
Both this sets can be checked in CGX with command ,prnt se'.

In the photo below, we can see the sets which are defined in gmsh, in CGX
