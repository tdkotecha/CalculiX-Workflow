# CalculiX-Workflow
CalculiX is a open-source Analysis Software. In this directory, I have tried to show the Workflow in CalculiX. 
Basically I have shown how to import a CAD geometry from a 3D-Modelling Software, Mesh the Geometry in different Meshing softwares like GMSH, Salome etc and then use them in CalculiX to do analysis on it.
