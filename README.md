# CalculiX-Workflow
CalculiX is a open-source analysis(FEA) Software. In this directory, I have tried to show the Workflow in CalculiX. 
Basically I have shown how to import a CAD geometry from a 3D-Modelling Software, mesh the Geometry in different Meshing softwares like GMSH, Salome etc and then use them in CalculiX to do analysis on it. 

In Workflow-PDF above, you can understand from very basic about CalculiX, For Example,

* How to install CalculiX?; Which problems occurs during installation and what is the solution for this problems?
* CalculiX workflow with different Softwares like Gmsh and Salome
* Problems and solution for Meshing a imported geometry (.Step File)
* Some examples to start with analysis in CalculiX
* Some reference videos, which can help in learning the basic analysis in Calculix and also workflow of Calculix with other softwares like Gmsh, Salome, Netgen and Mecway.

All the files above are checked with CaluliX 2.10 and Gmsh 2.10.1 in Linux.
